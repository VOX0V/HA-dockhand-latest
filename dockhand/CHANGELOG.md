## 1.0.2

- Fix: authentication login redirects to allow Dockhand user authentication.

## 1.0.1

- Fix: nginx startup no longer emits `initgroups(root, 0) failed (1: Operation not permitted)` in Home Assistant addon containers.
- Dev: implement release process

## 1.0.0

- Initial release
- Dockhand Docker management UI wrapped as a Home Assistant app
- Ingress support for sidebar access
- Docker socket passthrough (requires Protection Mode disabled)
- SQLite-backed persistent storage
- Known issue: Home Assistant ingress can log transient stream disconnect noise
  (`net::ERR_FAILED`, `Cannot write to closing transport`) during page navigation;
  this is usually benign when streams reconnect and UI remains responsive
